# Test project for Binovate

Implemented all APIs as it's described in the Messaging Application Challenge.
Additionally I have added "POST /v1/user" API to add users.
All request/response formats for each API are described within docstrings in the code.

To run service you will need docker and docker-compose.
Just clone the repo and execute "docker-compose up" from within the repo root. By default
service will be available from the host at 127.0.0.1/12345.
